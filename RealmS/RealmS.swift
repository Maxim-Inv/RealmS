   Performs actions contained within the given block inside a write transaction.

   on a `Realm` which is already in a write transaction will return an exception.
   Calls to `write` from `Realm` instances in other threads will block
   until the current write transaction completes.

   Before executing the write transaction, `write` updates the `Realm` to the
   latest Realm version, as if `refresh()` was called, and generates notifications
   if applicable. This has no effect if the `Realm` was already up to date.

   - returns: An NSError if the transaction could not be written.

   When the object has a primary key: If no objects exist in
   the Realm instance with the same primary key value, the object is inserted. Otherwise,
   the existing object is updated with any changed values.

   When added, all (child) relationships referenced by this object will also be
   added to the Realm if they are not already in it. If the object or any related
   objects already belong to a different Realm an exception will be thrown. Use one
   of the `create` functions to insert a copy of a persisted object into a different
   Realm.

   The object to be added must be valid and cannot have been previously deleted
   from a Realm (i.e. `invalidated` must be false).
