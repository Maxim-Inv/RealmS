[Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/tree/v0.97.1)
============

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the iOS & OSX versions of Realm, for both Swift & Objective-C.

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues. Plus, we've worked hard to [keep our API down to just 4 common classes](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/api/) (Object, Array, Results and Realms) and 1 utility class (Migrations): most of our users pick it up intuitively, getting simple apps up & running in minutes.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics, vectorization and even Swift.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
